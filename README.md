# HuffmanCode
A program that implements Huffman Coding. 

This program takes an input file, process it, and produce a prefix-free, variable length binary coding that minimizes the average codeword length. 

The input file can contain any series of string. Even this one! It can be a sentence, a word, or gibberish letters put together.
